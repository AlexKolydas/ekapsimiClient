Food ordering system client android

This native Android application allowed the staff of the military base where I served to order food and drinks from the base's cafeteria, while specifying their prefered location for delivery by the cafeteria's staff. The cafeteria staff were responsible for creating a catalogue using an administrator application I created, while the customers would order using a client application. 

Both mobile clients are native Android clients and the content (orders, menus and order history) is managed through Firebase.
